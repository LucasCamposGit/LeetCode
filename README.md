# LeetCode Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode coding challenges implemented in the Rust programming language.

## Project Structure

Each challenge has its own directory containing:
- A Rust project with solution code
- Tests to verify the solution

## Other Implementations

There is also a branch with TypeScript solutions to the same problems. You can check them out by switching to the TypeScript branch.

## Purpose

This project serves as:
- A way to practice algorithmic problem-solving
- A learning exercise for Rust programming
- A reference for different approaches to common coding challenges

Feel free to explore the solutions and compare different implementations!
